An early attempt/experiment at hacking together a vim/orgmode-like note-taking app/editor that would eventually centre around fuzzy searching.

Inputs are files in `*.opml` format. A small example file is included (`sample.opml`).

Run with `pipenv run python main.py`.

Currently in a very fragile state.
